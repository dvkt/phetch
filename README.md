        phetch [options]       Launch phetch in interactive mode
        phetch [options] url   Open Gopher URL in interactive mode

    Options:

        -s, --tls              Try to open Gopher URLs securely w/ TLS
        -o, --tor              Use local Tor proxy to open all pages
        -S, -O                 Disable TLS or Tor

        -v, --version          Show phetch version

    Command line options always override options set in phetch.conf.

    Once you've launched phetch, use `ctrl-h` to view the on-line help.

## installation

If you already have a Gopher client, download `phetch` here:

    gopher://phkt.io/1/phetch/latest

On macOS you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://macports.org). 
If you're using Homebrew, open the Terminal and type:

    brew install xvxx/code/phetch
    
For MacPorts:

    sudo port install phetch

On Arch Linux, install phetch with your favorite [AUR helper][aur]:

    yay phetch

On NetBSD, phetch is included in the main pkgsrc repo:

    pkgin install phetch

Binaries for Linux, Raspberry Pi, and Mac are available at
https://github.com/xvxx/phetch/releases:

- [phetch-v1.1.0-linux-x86_64.tgz][0]
- [phetch-v1.1.0-linux-armv7.tgz (Raspberry Pi)][1]
- [phetch-v1.1.0-macos.zip][2]

Just unzip/untar the `phetch` program into your `$PATH` and get going!

You can also build and install from source if you have `cargo`,
`make`, and the other dependencies described in the next section:

    git clone https://github.com/xvxx/phetch
    cd phetch
    env PREFIX=/usr/local make install

## development

To build with TLS support on **Linux**, you need `openssl` and
`pkg-config`:

    sudo apt install -y pkg-config libssl-dev

Regular development uses `cargo`:

    cargo run -- <gopher-url>

_Pro-tip:_ Run a local gopher server (like [phd]) on `0.0.0.0:7070`
and start phetch with `-l` or `--local` to quickly connect to it.
Useful for debugging!

phetch builds with TLS and Tor support by default. To disable these
features, or to enable only one of them, use the
`--no-default-features` flag:

    cargo build --no-default-features

You can check whether TLS is enabled by visiting the About page:

    cargo run --no-default-features -- gopher://phetch/about

To enable just TLS support, or just Tor support, use `--features`:

    cargo run --no-default-features --features tor -- gopher://phetch/about

## media player support

phetch includes support for opening video files (`;` item type) and
sound files (`s` item type) in [mpv] or an application of your choice
using the `-m` command line flag. To test it out, visit a compatible
Gopher server (maybe one using [Gophor]?). Or check out the "gopher
types" help page by pressing `ctrl-h` then `3` in phetch.
